<s> Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati, unveiling first findings of a special government commission, said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts.</s>
<s> """ In 1970s, Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs ."</s>
<s> "What was its right( to the money) ...I do not know, "" Rosati told a news conference ."</s>
<s> Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee, of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens, as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland.</s>
<s> Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war, when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland's 3.5 million Jews.</s>
<s> Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two.</s>
<s> """ I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided, "" Rosati said ."</s>
<s> Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports.</s>
<s> "He said, however, that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called "" dead accounts "" as part of the compensation ."</s>
<s> """ About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens, whose data we do not precisely know ."</s>
<s> "The issue is of moral and legal nature, because its financial significance is small, "" Rosati said ."</s>
<s> Under pressure from international Jewish organisations, Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims.</s>
<s> The conservative Radical Democrats( FDP) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs($ 31 million) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations.</s>
<s> But Swiss banks and the country's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work.</s>
<s> INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE.</s>
<s> Steven Silber WARSAW 1996-12-06 Polish brewer Zywiec's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges, but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share, the firm's chief executive said.</s>
<s> Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm, whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales, might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround.</s>
<s> So far this year Zywiec, whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA, has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys.</s>
<s> It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres.</s>
<s> Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer.</s>
<s> """ The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable, "" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption, currently around 40 litres ."</s>
<s> He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland, with its 40-million population, Europe's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain.</s>
<s> Van Boxmeer said Poland's top five brewers, which produce about 55 percent of the country's beer, could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors.</s>
<s> Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim.</s>
<s> Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd( SAB) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers, which together hold more than 20 percent of the market, and Australia's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland's larges t brewery, Elbrewery Company Ltd.( EB).</s>
<s> Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation, which had added to the pressure on the firm's margins.</s>
<s> He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share.</s>
<s> But he said the company's investment of more than$ 100 million already this decade, largely in production, would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic.</s>
<s> Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998, but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market's overcapacity.</s>
<s> """ I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers, "" he said ."</s>
<s> Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim, which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year, but that Zywiec's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one.</s>
<s> He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand, Zywiec Full Light, which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country's largest-selling brand.</s>
<s> """ You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands, "" van Boxmeer said, adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland ."</s>
<s> Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made.</s>

<s> Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines, final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic, which would create greater competition on the routes.</s>
<s> Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which was asked to examine the case last month.</s>
<s> """ I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S., "" he said ."</s>
<s> His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed.</s>
<s> Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared.</s>
<s> The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe.</s>
<s> "American's parent, AMR Corp., said it did not view the terms as a "" deal breaker. "" However, it called the conditions "" more severe "" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances ."</s>
<s> "British Airways's initial response was that "" unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value. "" It added that it would be "" prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition. "" The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes, and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter ."</s>
<s> It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route.</s>
<s> The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways/ American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme.</s>

<s> Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder, and that if a rival buyer is found, Newmont may not be able to match its offer.</s>
<s> They said the Santa Fe deal, which includes desirable Nevada mining territory, would only payoff for Newmont longer term.</s>
<s> Newmont, in fact, will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years, which also limits its capacity to raise its offer.</s>

<s> """ We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access( to the large group of refugees) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies ."</s>
<s> """ If they ca n't move because they are too weak, then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means( airdrops) ...It's complex, it's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary ."</s>
<s> "If it is necessary, I wo n't hesitate to use it, "" he said ."</s>
<s> "Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government, he said: "" It would have to be in the last resort ."</s>
<s> It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger.</s>
<s> "Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire. "" Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter, the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security ."</s>

<s> This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara, a high-ranking Finance Ministry official, who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen.</s>
<s> But many in the market thought Sakakibara's real intentions lay elsewhere, and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government's stance on the dollar, dealers said.</s>
