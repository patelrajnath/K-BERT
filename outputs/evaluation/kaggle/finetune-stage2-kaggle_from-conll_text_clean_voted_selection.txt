The assessment by CIA special advisor Charles Duelfer , head of the Iraq Survey Group , was contained in an addendum , posted on the Internet late Monday , to last year 's final report on Iraq 's weapons program .

The economy suffers from the typical Pacific island problems of geographic isolation , few resources , and a small population .
Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues , and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees .
Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half .
The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening , although some cash crops are grown for export .
Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit , lime oil , honey , and coconut cream .
The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue .
The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand .
Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services , although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses .
Economic aid from New Zealand in FY08/09 was US $ 5.7 million .
Niue suffered a devastating typhoon in January 2004 , which decimated nascent economic programs .
While in the process of rebuilding , Niue has been dependent on foreign aid .
British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and Africa 's most populous country grew through the 19th century .
A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy ; independence came in 1960 .
Following nearly 16 years of military rule , a new constitution was adopted in 1999 , and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed .
The government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy , whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement , and institutionalizing democracy .
In addition , Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions .
Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence , Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence .
The general elections of April 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country 's history .
In January 2010 , Nigeria assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010 - 11 term .
Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years ( 1824 - 1886 ) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire .
Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate , self-governing colony ; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948 .
Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988 , first as military ruler , then as self-appointed president , and later as political kingpin .
In September 1988 , the military deposed NE WIN and established a new ruling junta .
Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) - winning a landslide victory , the junta refused to hand over power .
NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI , who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002 , was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest .
She was finally released in November 2010 .
After the ruling junta in August 2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices , tens of thousands of Burmese marched in protest , led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks .
In late September 2007 , the government brutally suppressed the protests , killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations .
Since then , the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests .
Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis , which claimed over 1,38,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless .
Despite this tragedy , the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum , the first vote in Burma since 1990 .
Parliamentary elections held in November 2010 , considered flawed by many in the international community , saw the junta 's Union Solidarity and Development Party garnering over 75 % of the seats .
Parliament convened in January 2011 and selected former Prime Minister THEIN SEIN as president .
The vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN are former or current military officers .
Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange especially since the construction of an international airport in 1985 .
Hurricanes Ivan ( 2004 ) and Emily ( 2005 ) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth .
Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process .
Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110 % , leaving the THOMAS administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending .
Strong performances in construction and manufacturing , together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry , have also contributed to growth in national output ; however , economic growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009 , because of the global economic slowdown 's effects on tourism and remittances .
One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering .
When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away , because he thought a trick had been played upon him .
But he took it home on second thoughts , and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold .
Every morning the same thing occurred , and he soon became rich by selling his eggs .
As he grew rich he grew greedy ; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give , he killed it and opened it only to find nothing .
Greed oft o'er reaches itself .
A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes , and could not see any one approaching her on that side .
So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea , with her sound eye looking towards the land .
By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land , and often escaped by this means .
But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye , and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea .
""" Ah , "" cried she with her dying voice ,"
""" You can not escape your fate . """
A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure one of them .
The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him , as against an enemy , and kept a strict watch over his movements .
But when the Wolf , day after day , kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them , the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it ; and when occasion called him one day into the city , he left the sheep entirely in his charge .
The Wolf , now that he had the opportunity , fell upon the sheep , and destroyed the greater part of the flock .
When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed , he exclaimed :
""" I have been rightly served ; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf ? '"

Krygyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev says he is ready for any new proposals from the U.S. government to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan .
Mr. Bakiyev made his comments to the British Broadcasting Corporation Wednesday .
But Kyrgyz officials said Thursday the government will not reverse its decision to evict U.S. forces from a key military base that supports Western troops in Afghanistan .
Last week , Kyrgyzstan ordered U.S. forces to leave the Manas air base within six months after President Bakiyev signed the decision into law .
"U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he believes the issue is not "" closed , "" and that the U.S. will try to reach a new agreement with Kyrgyzstan ."
As an alternative , Gates said the U.S. is considering other supply routes .
Manas Air Base is currently the only U.S. military supply route in Central Asia .
A top U.S. military officer said Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to allow the transit of non-lethal U.S. cargo through their territory to Afghanistan .
Washington also has received permission from Russia and Kazakhstan to send supplies to Afghanistan by rail .
President Bakiyev had complained that Washington was not paying enough rent for the base .
He announced plans to close it after Russia pledged to give Kyrgyzstan about $ 2 billion in loans and aid .

A secular coalition led by Iraq 's former prime minister has taken a slight lead in overall votes as ballot counting from parliamentary elections continues - but it remains behind in the key provincial tally .
With about 93 percent of the ballots counted , election officials said Saturday that former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi 's secularists lead the Shi'ite coalition headed by current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by about 8,000 votes .
The lead has repeatedly shifted between Mr. Allawi and Prime Minister Maliki since the March 7 vote .
But Mr. Maliki 's State of Law coalition is still ahead in seven of Iraq 's 18 provinces - compared to five provinces held by Mr. Allawi 's Iraqiya alliance .
Seats in Iraq 's 325-member parliament are won according to how well a coalition does in a province , not according to the overall vote .
Officials say they hope to have final results by the end of the month .

And the recent earthquake , officials say , is likely to fuel even higher inflation because of the damage to the country 's agriculture .
Sam Beattie reports from Beijing .
German authorities have released a Lebanese man arrested in connection with an alleged plot against Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi .
But prosecutors have issued arrest orders against three others accused of planning to attack Mr. Allawi during his visit to Germany last week .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet Sunday that the Israeli government does not need to provide funding to the performers taking part in the boycott .
Mr. Netanyahu said the performers ' actions play into the hands of international efforts to delegitimize Israel with economic and cultural boycotts .

Officials said Sunday former center-left president Alan Garcia leads pro-business congresswoman Lourdes Flores by less than 96,000 votes , with nearly 90 percent of the votes counted .
Garcia led Flores by nearly 1,10,000 votes on Saturday .
The surge by Flores is attributed to heavy support among Peruvians living abroad whose votes are apparently starting to impact the election tally .

Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue .
Petroleum accounts for roughly 25 % of GDP and 70 % of government revenue .
Yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment .

Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s , Qatar transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues .
During the late 1980s and early 1990s , the Qatari economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by the Amir , who had ruled the country since 1972 .
His son , the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani , overthrew him in a bloodless coup in 1995 .
In 2001 , Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia .
As of 2007 , oil and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the second-highest per capita income in the world .
Subsistence agriculture , together with forestry , remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic ( CAR ) , with about 60 % of the population living in outlying areas .

You find the present tense and the past perfect .
My grandfather worked in a blacksmith shop when he was a boy , and he used to tell me how he had toughened himself up so he could stand the rigors of blacksmithing .
He said he would stand outside behind the house and , with a 5 pound potato sack in each hand , extend his arms straight out to his sides and hold them there as long as he could .
After a while he tried 10 pound potato sacks , then 20 pound potato sacks and finally he got to where he could lift a 50 pound potato sack in each hand and hold his arms straight out for five full minutes ! Eventually , he even started putting potatoes in the sacks .
Advance copies of the United Nations ' internal audit of its oil-for-food program reportedly show that U.N. officials wasted money and overlooked massive overcharges by contractors .
News reports published Sunday in the United States say the audits , part of an extensive independent report to be released on Monday , criticize a former top aide to Secretary-General Kofi Annan , Benon Sevan , and the U.N. office he headed that ran the oil-for-food program .

The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science .
At its zenith in the 19th century , the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth 's surface .
The first half of the 20th century saw the UK 's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the union .
The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation .
As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council , a founding member of NATO , and of the Commonwealth , the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy .
The UK is also an active member of the EU , although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union .
The Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999 .

Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century , initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors , including : disease from mosquito-infested swamps , brutal heat , resistance by natives , and pirate raids .
It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler , fertile central highlands .
The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries .
In 1821 , Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain .
Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America , but this federation disintegrated in 1838 , at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence .
Since the late 19th century , only two brief periods of violence have marred the country 's democratic development .
In 1949 , Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces .
Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector , Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries .
The standard of living is relatively high .
Land ownership is widespread .
Subsistence fishing and commercial trawling occur within refuge waters .
The economy is dominated by the mining industry , with exports of alumina , gold , and oil accounting for about 85 % of exports and 25 % of government revenues , making the economy highly vulnerable to mineral price volatility .
In 2000 , the government of Ronald VENETIAAN , returned to office and inherited an economy with inflation of over 100 % and a growing fiscal deficit .
He quickly implemented an austerity program , raised taxes , attempted to control spending , and tamed inflation .
Economic growth reached about 7 % in 2008 , owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and oil .
Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold mining sectors from Netherlands , Belgium , and the European Development Fund .
The economy slowed in 2009 , however , as investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity exports when global prices for most commodities fell .
Trade picked up , boosting Suriname 's economic growth in 2010 , but the government 's budget remained strained , with increased social spending during the election .
In January 2011 , the government devalued the currency by 20 % and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit .
Suriname 's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition .
Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the island in 1498 , but it remained uncolonized for more than a century .

A brief ceremony to officially open the talks took place shortly after midnight Tuesday in Luxembourg .
Talks had been scheduled to open Monday .
If accepted , Turkey would be the first country with a majority Muslim population to join the European Union .

Brazilian lawmakers have approved legislation that will give the government more control over developing offshore oil fields .
The lower house of the Brazilian congress passed the bill Wednesday , sending it to outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for his signature .
The measure allows the state-owned oil company , known as Petrobras , to be the sole operator of unexplored offshore oil fields , as well as a 30 percent stake in any joint ventures .
Brazil has discovered potentially large oil reserves off the country 's southeastern coast , some of them thousands of meters below the sea floor .
Some estimates say the fields may contain more than 50 billion barrels of oil .
Brazilian lawmakers also approved a provision that will allow non-oil producing states to receive more oil revenues .

The nuclear cooperation pact between India and the United States has sparked a mixed reaction in Washington and abroad .
International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei praised the agreement , saying it would bring India closer as an important partner in the non-proliferation group of countries .
But some U.S. lawmakers criticized the deal , saying the agreement that could give India access to U.S. civilian nuclear technology would undermine the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
India has not signed the treaty , which restricts the sharing of some nuclear technology with non-member nations , and drew widespread international criticism for conducting nuclear weapons tests as recently as 1998 .
Full details of the nuclear cooperation pact have not been released , but the agreement must still be approved by Congress before taking effect .
President Bush acknowledged Thursday that hard work still needs to be done to gain the necessary approval in Congress .
A Sudanese analyst says the late rebel leader John Garang was a symbol of the struggle for greater federalism in the country .
Lecturer John Gai Yoh of the University of South Africa ( UNISA ) in Pretoria credits the leader of the Sudanese Liberation Movement with creating a campaign that included allies beyond his base in the south .
Mr. Yoh notes that his vision materialized with the comprehensive peace agreement signed last January between the former SPLA rebels and the government in Khartoum .
Analyst John Gai Yoh predicts that the SPLA will continue to democratize : it has created a new SPLA parliament for the south and has named a new five-man military panel to lead the movement .

Mr. Roosevelt was president from 1933 until 1945 .
An Ethiopian government spokesman denies that a reported rebel attack said to have killed 140 soldiers ever took place .
The spokesman , Zemedkun Tekle , issued the denial Sunday after media reports said the Ogaden National Liberation Front had claimed to have carried out the deadly attack Saturday in southeastern Ethiopia near Wardheer .
A purported statement from the group received by some news organizations said about a thousand rebels took part in the attack and seized ammunition along with military hardware .
The government spokesman says there was no attack , and that the rebel group is not in a position to carry out such an attack .
Rebels have been fighting for more autonomy for ethnic Somalis in the eastern region of Ogaden bordering Somalia .

Palestinian security officials say masked Palestinian police briefly stormed a government building in the Gaza Strip in anger over not receiving their salaries from the Hamas-led government .
Security officials say about 50 police officers sealed off the main road Saturday in the central Gaza town of Khan Younis .
They say the masked police surrounded a municipal government building , taking positions on the roof and firing in the air .
The protest is seen as a sign of discontent with the new Hamas-led government , which took office late last month .
The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority has not been able to pay salaries to some 1,40,000 government employees since March .
Western nations have cut off aid to the Palestinian government , demanding that Hamas renounce violence and recognize Israel .
"The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in "" significant quantities "" in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions ."
The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations .
Previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment .
Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications .
"The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "" because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . """
Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences .
U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .
Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century , Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century .
The French assumed control in 1715 , developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade , and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane .
The British captured the island in 1810 , during the Napoleonic Wars .
Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base , and later an air station , playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations , as well as the collection of signals intelligence .
Independence from the UK was attained in 1968 .
A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record , the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa 's highest per capita incomes .
Recent poor weather , declining sugar prices , and declining textile and apparel production , have slowed economic growth , leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community .
Morocco 's market economy benefits from the country 's relatively low labor costs and proximity to Europe , which aid key areas of the economy such as agriculture , light manufacturing , tourism , and remittances .
Morocco is also the world 's largest exporter of phosphate , which has long provided a source of export earnings and economic stability .
Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with generally low inflation , improved financial performance , and steady progress in developing the service and industrial sectors .
In 2006 , Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US , and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU .
However , poverty , illiteracy , and unemployment rates remain high .
In response to these challenges , King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human Development , a $ 2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing , among other policies .
Morocco 's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010 , and reducing government spending and adapting to sluggish economic growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011 .
Morocco 's long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for young Moroccans , closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor , confronting corruption , and expanding and diversifying exports beyond phosphates and low-value-added products .
Albania , a formerly closed , centrally-planned state , is making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy .
Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6 % between 2004 - 8 , but declined to about 3 % in 2009 - 10 .
Inflation is low and stable .
The government has taken measures to curb violent crime , and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment .
Remittances , a significant catalyst for economic growth have declined from Dec-15 % of GDP to 9 % of GDP in 2009 , mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy ; this helps offset the towering trade deficit .
The agricultural sector , which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP , is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment , unclear property rights , and the prevalence of small , inefficient plots of land .
Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower , and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania 's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country 's export base .
FDI is among the lowest in the region , but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms .
The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity , and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages .
Also , with help from EU funds , the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network , a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth .
Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing .
The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting , except for high-grade phosphate .
The potential for a tourist industry exists , but the remote location , a lack of adequate facilities , and limited air connections hinder development .
Under the original terms of the Compact of Free Association , the US provided $ 1.3 billion in grant aid during the period 1986 - 2001 ; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced .
The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) millions of dollars in annual aid through 2023 , and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023 .
The country 's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector .
The discovery and exploitation of large oil and gas reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth but fluctuating oil prices have produced huge swings in GDP growth in recent years .
Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP .
Subsistence farming is the dominate form of livelihood .
Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings , the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth ( the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture ) .
A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement .
The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues ; however , in 2010 , under Equatorial Guinea 's candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , the government published oil revenue figures for the first time .
Undeveloped natural resources include gold , zinc , diamonds , columbite-tantalite , and other base metals .
Growth remained strong in 2008 , when oil production peaked , but slowed in 2009 - 10 , as the price of oil and the production level fell .
A BOSS who had gone to Canada was taunted by a Citizen of Montreal with having fled to avoid prosecution .
""" You do me a grave injustice , "" said the Boss , parting with a pair of tears ."
""" I came to Canada solely because of its political attractions ; its Government is the most corrupt in the world . """
""" Pray forgive me , "" said the Citizen of Montreal ."
They fell upon each other 's neck , and at the conclusion of that touching rite the Boss had two watches .
There are less than three months until the election , an election that will decide the next President of the United States .

It 's time that we all came together , Democrats and Republicans alike .
If you support the policies and character of President George W. Bush , please drive with your headlights on during the day .
If you support John Kerry , please drive with your headlights off at night .
A topologist is a person who does n't know the difference between a coffee cup and a doughnut .
Lawyers get a lot of unjust criticism .
I would remind you that it is not right to condemn a whole profession just because of 3,50,000 bad apples .
I was very lonely when I was a child .
I only had two imaginary friends ...
And they would only play with each other .
The Russian and European space agencies have announced a deal to build a manned spacecraft for near-earth orbits and trips to the moon .
Russian news agency reports quote a spokesman for the Russian agency Roskosmos as saying engineers want to test a 20-ton capsule by 2015 .
A first launch is planned for 2018 at a launch center in Siberia .
Under the pact , Russia will build the capsule , while European engineers build the service module and the engine block .
The new craft is to be phased in as the replacement for Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft , which has come under increased scrutiny this year , after two consecutive rough landings on return from the International Space Station .
A human-rights group in Niger says the government is to blame for cancellation of a ceremony that was to grant 7,000 slaves their freedom .
The group Timidria had planned to release the slaves in the Ates region near Niger 's western border with Mali on Saturday , but the event was called off when none of the slaves showed up .
The rights group says the government intimidated slaves to keep them from attending the ceremony - a charge the government denies .
Niger officially banned slavery in 2003 , but human-rights groups say 43,000 people are still in bondage in the West African nation .
They are among the 2,00,000 people enslaved along centuries-old Arab-African Saharan trade routes .
Generations of Africans have been born in slavery , many under the ownership of one family .
Embattled Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo has said he wants to talk with his rival , Alassane Ouattara .
Mr. Gbagbo has been isolated by the international community , including the United States , after refusing to yield the presidency although he had fewer votes than Mr. Ouattara in last month 's poll .
Both men have taken the oath of office and begun organizing competing governments .
Earlier this week , the African Union dispatched former South African president Thabo Mbeki to seek a solution , but after two days of talks , the situation was not resolved .
The Ivory Coast 's presidential election , its first in 10 years , was meant to restore stability to the West African country , which was split into rebel- and government-controlled areas during a 2002 civil war .
Officials in Afghanistan say a suicide bomber has killed four Afghan employees of a U.S.-owned private security firm and wounded one other in southern Kandahar province .

Turkish police have detained more than 80 people and used tear gas to prevent thousands of leftist protesters from marching to Istanbul 's Taksim square to hold a May Day rally .
Authorities declared the square off-limits to protesters , but allowed a small number of trade union leaders to lay flowers at the square to mark the day .
Officials had shut down schools in the area for the day for fear of violence .
Members of leftist groups often clash with police during May Day observances in Turkey .
In 1977 , a May Day rally at Taksim square turned violent when unidentified gunmen opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators .
Thirty-seven people were killed in that incident .
The race for Iraq 's new prime minister narrowed Tuesday , when one of two top Shi'ite parties withdrew its candidate from consideration .
Interim Finance Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi , who had been the candidate of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , withdrew his name from contention .
This leaves the head of the Islamic Dawa Party , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , as the likely front-runner .
Both parties belong to the United Iraqi Alliance , which won about 48 percent of the vote for the National Assembly .
Meanwhile , Iraq 's Electoral Commission says it has received at least three complaints from political groups challenging the election results .

And Turkish shipping magnate Kahraman Sadikoglu , who was abducted in southern Iraq in December , has been freed after reports said his family paid a ransom to his kidnappers .
A Council of Europe panel says Turkey has passed important legislation protecting minority rights , but has not adequately enforced the new laws .
In a report , the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance says that despite the new legislation , Turkey 's constitution and its civil , criminal and administrative laws continue to have gaps in addressing racism .
The report , issued Tuesday in Strasbourg , says Kurds and other minorities still face adversity in Turkey , particularly from ongoing violence in the southeast where Kurdish separatists have been active in recent decades .
Turkey 's move to push through legal and economic reforms is considered an essential part of its bid to join the European Union .
The Council of Europe is a 46-nation group that brings together lawmakers from democratic European countries to review major issues facing the continent .

He said if it appears that there is coordination between terrorist states and leftist organizations in Central America , the United States will intervene .
Representative Burton said such a relationship would endanger the United States and other countries in the hemisphere .
European Union foreign ministers hold emergency talks in Luxembourg Sunday in efforts to break a deadlock on Turkey , which is scheduled to begin membership negotiations with the bloc one day later .
The ministers called the meeting after Austria insisted that EU talks with Turkey should include an alternative to giving the country full membership .
Austria says most Austrians object to full EU membership for Turkey and suggested offering Turkey privileged partnership instead .
But Turkey calls that unacceptable and says it will not take part in Monday 's talks unless it is clear that the goal is full membership .
EU diplomats are working on proposals to soften Austrian opposition .
One would be a commitment to begin membership talks with Austria 's neighbor Croatia in the near future .
EU ministers had delayed the talks because of Croatian failure to cooperate fully with The Hague war crimes tribunal .

New studies by British and French researchers show quick treatment for minor strokes can dramatically cut the risk of major strokes later .
The research , published in the journals Lancetand Lancet Neurology , found that patients treated within 24 hours for so-called mini-strokes cut the later risk of a major stroke by about 80 percent .
Oxford researcher Peter Rothwell says the vast majority of British stroke patients wait several weeks before reporting mini-stroke symptoms to health care professionals .
The second study by French researchers also found that the early , aggressive treatment of mini-strokes brought similar benefits .
Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked .
Such events kill brain tissue and are one of the leading causes of death or permanent disability worldwide .
Symptoms include facial numbness , slurred speech , partial paralysis and sudden headaches .
Treatments include blood thinning drugs and anti-cholesterol medications .

Magna International Inc. 's chief financial officer , James McAlpine , resigned and its chairman , Frank Stronach , is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around , the company said .
"Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending "" until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained , "" Magna said ."
Stephen Akerfeldt , currently vice president finance , will succeed Mr. McAlpine .
An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .
The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth .

Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719 .
Disputed between France and the United Kingdom for most of the 18th century , the island was ceded to the latter in 1783 .
Between 1960 and 1962 , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies .
Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979 .
The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the latter 's dissolution at the end of World War I .
In 1918 , the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state , which was named Yugoslavia in 1929 .
After World War II , Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia , which though Communist , distanced itself from Moscow 's rule .
Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs , the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war .
Historical ties to Western Europe , a strong economy , and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia 's transformation to a modern state .
Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 ; it joined the eurozone in 2007 .
The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta ; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire .
From the 16th to 19th centuries , Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes ; in 1852 , it was transformed into a secular principality .
After World War I , Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes , which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ; at the conclusion of World War II , it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
When the latter dissolved in 1992 , Montenegro federated with Serbia , first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and , after 2003 , in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro .
In May 2006 , Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union .
The vote for severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55 % - the threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June 2006 .
Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966 .
The Basuto National Party ruled for the first two decades .

Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule .
In 1998 , violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community .

Tourism , petroleum refining , and offshore finance are the mainstays of this small economy , which is closely tied to the outside world .
Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade , the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region .
Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers .
The Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery on the island from the government ; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela ; most of the refined products are exported to the US .
Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported , with the US , Brazil , Italy , and Mexico being the major suppliers .
The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there .
Poor soils and inadequate water supplies hamper the development of agriculture .

The United Nations says that restoring tens of thousands of degraded wetlands around the world could help reduce the threat of a bird flu pandemic .
Preliminary findings of the report were released Tuesday during a conference at the U.N. Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi , Kenya .
The report says the loss of wetlands is forcing many wild birds into alternative habitats like farm ponds and paddy fields .
It says these habitats increase the risk of the birds spreading avian flu to domestic birds like chickens .

Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics , Croatia 's economy suffered badly during the 1991 - 95 war as output collapsed and the country missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Between 2000 and 2007 , however , Croatia 's economic fortunes began to improve slowly , with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4 % and 6 % led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending .
Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency , the kuna , stable .
Nevertheless , difficult problems still remain , including a stubbornly high unemployment rate , a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development .
The state retains a large role in the economy , as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance .
While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved , structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians .
The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform .
While long term growth prospects for the economy remain strong , Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the global financial crisis .
Croatia 's high foreign debt , anemic export sector , strained state budget , and over-reliance on tourism revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium term .

But , new electoral laws signed into law by Mr. Mugabe last week , for the first time give the military , police and prison officials a substantial role in the next poll , and they can , if recruited to serve , control voting and counting .
There was a frenzy of lawmaking late last year to establish new legislation and electoral authorities ahead of the poll which Mr. Mugabe says will be held in March ahead of his 25th anniversary of coming to power in 1980 .
The MDC suspended participation in all elections five months ago because it said the electoral playing field was uneven .
It said it would only take part when Zimbabwe 's laws and practice complied with regional electoral principles agreed to by Mr. Mugabe and other southern African countries last August .
However most political analysts believe the MDC will take part in the general election , despite Zimbabwe 's lack of compliance with regional electoral practices and laws .
Western observers are not expected to be invited to cover Zimbabwe 's poll as they said the last two national elections were neither free nor fair .

Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources .
The two largest crops are cotton , most of which is produced for export , and wheat , which is domestically consumed .
Although agriculture accounts for roughly 10 % of GDP , it continues to employ nearly half of the country 's workforce .
With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure , Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform , hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy .
Privatization goals remain limited .
From 1998 - 2005 , Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt .
At the same time , however , total exports rose by an average of roughly 15 % per year from 2003 - 8 , largely because of higher international oil and gas prices .
New pipelines to China and Iran , that began operation in early 2010 , have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas , although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia .
Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty , endemic corruption , a poor educational system , government misuse of oil and gas revenues , and Ashgabat 's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms .
In the past , Turkmenistan 's economic statistics were state secrets .
The new government has established a State Agency for Statistics , but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error .
In particular , the rate of GDP growth is uncertain .
Since his election , President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country 's dual currency exchange rate , ordered the redenomination of the manat , reduced state subsidies for gasoline , and initiated development of a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea .

Chan called for more innovation in developing new medicines to ensure everyone gets the vaccine .
WHO officials have said they believe the first mass vaccines will be available by September and that health care providers should get inoculated first .
The latest WHO report confirms nearly 95,000 swine flu cases worldwide with 429 deaths .
Political analysts say the results of some close elections across the United States could be delayed for days or weeks , as absentee and provisional ballots are counted .
Many states have allowed voters to cast absentee ballots for weeks .
Those votes , however , usually take longer to count , and a final tally of the results from those ballots could take days .

In 2004 , the first year provisional ballots were used nationwide , about 1.9 million people cast them .
More than 1.2 million of those votes were ruled valid .
In the northwestern state of Washington in 2004 , provisional ballots played a role in delaying Democratic gubernatorial candidate Christine Gregoire 's victory for more than eight weeks .

Moscow refuses to pay a newly imposed customs tax by Minsk for its oil crossing Belarus , which supplies 20 percent of Russian oil to Europe .
Oil also declined as traders expressed skepticism OPEC plans to cut oil production by another 5,00,000 barrels per day .
The international oil cartel agreed to a production cut of one million barrels per day in November , but prices have continued to drop .
The White House is hailing an upcoming Israeli-Palestinian summit in Egypt , calling it an encouraging step that shows both sides want to seize the opportunity for peace .

Egyptian security forces have arrested at least 10 more members of the country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim Brotherhood .
Thursday 's arrests come after 17 Brotherhood members were detained earlier this week .
The Egyptian government is intensifying its crackdown on the banned Islamist political group .
The Brotherhood says the government campaign is a direct reaction to the group 's rejection of constitutional amendments proposed by President Hosni Mubarak .
Officials of the Brotherhood say the amendments are aimed at giving the ruling party more power and barring Muslim Brothers from politics .
The Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Egypt 's parliament by running members as independents in the 2005 elections , making it the largest opposition group .
The constitutional amendments proposed by Mr. Mubarak would reduce the role of judges in monitoring elections and ban religious groups from forming political parties .
The Brotherhood advocates an Islamic state , achieved through peaceful means .

Having a small , open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to economic developments in Europe and dependent on regional integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic growth .
At independence in September 1991 , Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics , producing a mere 5 % of the total federal output of goods and services .
The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de~facto free trade area .
An absence of infrastructure , UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia , and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country 's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996 .
Since then , Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation , but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs , despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms .
Official unemployment remains high at 31.7 % , but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market , estimated to be more than 20 % of GDP , that is not captured by official statistics .
In the wake of the global economic downturn , Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment , lowered credit , and a large trade deficit .
However , as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system , in 2010 the country received slightly improved credit ratings .
Macroeconomic stability also was maintained by a prudent monetary policy , which kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro , while interest rates were falling .
As a result , GDP growth was modest , but positive , in 2010 .
In late 1999 , about 70 % of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias .
Three hundred thousand people fled westward .
Over the next three years a massive international program , manned by 5,000 peacekeepers ( 8,000 at peak ) and 1,300 police officers , led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas .
By the end of 2005 , refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia .
The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure , strengthening the civil administration , and generating jobs for young people entering the work force .
The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues .
This technology-intensive industry , however , has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste .
Gas is piped to Australia .
In June 2005 , the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste 's petroleum wealth for future generations .
The Fund held assets of US $ 6.6 billion as of October 2010 .
The economy continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest , which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity .
The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 1,00,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) ; most IDPs returned home by early 2009 .
Government spending increased markedly in 2009 and 2010 , primarily on basic infrastructure , including electricity and roads .
Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects .
The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty .
Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries , and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809 .
It won its complete independence in 1917 .
During World War II , it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory .
In the subsequent half century , the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm / forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy ; per capita income is now among the highest in Western Europe .
A member of the European Union since 1995 , Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999 .
In the 21st century , the key features of Finland 's modern welfare state are a high standard of education , equality promotion , and national social security system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy .
